# connect4-square
Its a connect 4 game with a twist,instead of making horizontal ,vertical or diagonal lines of four our objective here is to make sqaures. 
 
 
 The given code is a Python implementation of a Connect 4 game. The game board is represented by a 6x7 matrix, and players take turns dropping their respective pieces into the board. The objective of the game is to connect four pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
The code uses the Pygame library for visual display and user interaction. The board is displayed as a graphical window with coloured circles representing the game pieces. The code also implements a basic AI opponent, which uses a scoring function to determine the best move to make.
The code defines functions to create the game board, drop game pieces, check for valid moves, check for a winning move, and score potential moves. The scoring function prioritizes forming a 2x2 square of the player's pieces.
Overall, the given code provides a working implementation of a basic Connect 4 game with a simple AI opponent. Further improvements could be made to the scoring function to make the AI more challenging, and additional features could be added, such as a menu system and multiple game modes.
